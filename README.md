# Mezzolistr Music App

## Description

Mezzolistr is a mini music app that fetches three musicians data. It's a task that I was asked to do in Dufuna Code Camp.
What this app does is basically selecting one song periodically from one of these three African artistes: Fela Kuti, Bob Marley, and Brenda Fassie, and stores it in the database. The test version checks every ten seconds, while the production version checks every one minute.
